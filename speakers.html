         <p><b>Bio:</b> Akane Sano is an Assistant Professor at Rice University, Department of Electrical Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Bioengineering.  She directs the Computational Wellbeing Group and is a member of Scalable Health Labs.
                        Her research includes data science, machine learning, and human-centered intelligent systems for health and wellbeing and spans in the field of affective computing, ubiquitous and wearable computing, and biobehavioral sensing and analysis/modeling. Her research targets (1) the analysis and modeling of human ambulatory multimodal time series data including physiological, biological and behavioral data and surveys for measuring, predicting, improving, and understanding human physiology and behavior and human factors such as health, wellbeing, and performance and (2) development of human-centered computing technologies for health, wellbeing, and performance. She has been working on developing tools, algorithms, and systems to measure, forecast, understand and improve health and wellbeing using multimodal data from mobile and wearable sensors, devices in daily life settings, and clinical assessment especially for measuring, predicting, and intervening/improving clinical outcomes, stress, mental health, sleep, and performance. 
                        She obtained her PhD at MIT Media Lab, and her MEng and BEng at Keio University, Japan. Before she joined Rice University, she was a Research Scientist in Affective Computing Group at MIT Media Lab, and a visiting scientist/lecturer at People-Aware Computing Lab, Cornell University. Before she came to the US, she was a researcher/engineer at Sony Corporation focusing on wearable computing, intelligent systems, and human/computer interaction.

             <p><b>Title:</b> Machine Learning in Mental Health</p>
             <p><b>Abstract:</b> Recent advances in AI and machine learning (ML) promise significant transformations in the future delivery of (mental) healthcare. Despite a surge in research and development, few works have moved beyond demonstrations of technical feasibility and algorithmic performance. However, to realize many of the ambitious visions for how AI can contribute to clinical impact requires the closer design and study of ML tools or interventions within specific health and care contexts. This talk draws on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-talia/">Project Talia</a>, a recently retired, three-year research collaboration between Microsoft Research and SilverCloud Health, to describe current challenges and opportunities for applications of ML in mental health when designing for real-world implementation.
               <a href="https://www.silvercloudhealth.com/uk">SilverCloudHealth</a> is an evidence-based, digital, on-demand mental health platform that delivers Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) programs for patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Patients work through therapy contents by themselves in their own time in combination with regular assistance from an iCBT supporter, who provides guidance and continuous encouragement to the patient and helps them work through identified difficulties. Aiming to maximize the effects and outcomes of human support in this format, the collaboration explored how methods of ML could assist iCBT supporters in providing more effective, personalized care to their patients. To this end, the talk will give an introduction to three specific invstigations for deriving ML insights: (1) user subtyping based on patterns of engagement; (2) extracting context-specific communication patterns; and (3) predicting reliable improvement outcomes. It closes with broader socio-technical considerations and challenges involved for the responsible design and workflow integration of ML within sensitive healthcare contexts.</p>
             <p><b>Bio:</b> Anja is a Senior Researcher in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/biomedical-imaging/">Biomedical Imaging</a> team within Microsoft Health Futures, based at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/">Microsoft Research Cambridge</a>. Her research explores innovative approaches for applying AI and Machine Learning in real-world healthcare contexts with a focus towards end-to-end AI application development. As a researcher with a background in human-computer interaction (HCI) much of her work focuses on the responsible design of AI technology to benefit people.</p>
