      <p>
        With recent advancements in ubiquitous computing (smartphones, wearables, smart speakers etc.), ubicomp technology has
        deeply spread into our daily lives, including office work, home and
        housekeeping, health management, transportation, and even urban living
        environments. Furthermore, beyond the initial metrics commonly applied
        in computing, such as <i>efficiency</i> and <i>productivity</i>, the benefits
        that people (users) get from well-being-aware ubiquitous technology have
        been greatly emphasized in the recent years. Through the fifth
        "WellComp" (Computing for Well-being) workshop, we will discuss and
        debate the contribution of ubiquitous computing in users'
        well-being covering both physical, mental, and social wellness (and the
        combinations thereof), from the viewpoints of different layers
        of computing. Organized by a diverse international team of ubicomp
        researchers, WellComp 2023 will be hosted at
        <a href="https://ubicomp.org/ubicomp-iswc-2023/">Ubicomp/ISWC 2023</a> and will bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to explore versatile
        topics related to well-being and ubiquitous computing.
